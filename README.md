# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Hybrid Dataset and Machine Learning

Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is a significant global health concern and a leading cause of mortality worldwide. Accurate prediction of CVD risk is crucial for healthcare practitioners to make informed decisions about patient health. Machine learning models have emerged as powerful tools for assisting in health diagnoses, offering a promising approach for predicting CVD risk.

This repository presents a comprehensive study aimed at developing an effective prediction model for CVD risk. The primary goal is to provide a hybrid dataset that enhances the accuracy of prediction models by combining datasets from multiple sources, addressing missing values through innovative imputation techniques.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Hybrid Dataset Creation:** We combine datasets from different regions, including Hungary, Switzerland, Cleveland, and Long Beach, that are commonly used in heart disease prediction. These datasets often contain missing values, which can significantly affect the performance of prediction models. Our focus is on creating a hybrid dataset that includes the collective attributes from these sources.

2. **Missing Value Imputation:** We address the issue of missing values by applying distinct imputation techniques, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Mean, Mode, and Median imputation. This process helps us generate a new dataset named the "Sathvi" dataset. The resultant dataset contains 920 instances and 14 attributes, ensuring that there are no null values.

3. **Predictive Modeling:** We employ various machine learning classifiers to predict CVD risk using the Sathvi dataset. The classifiers include k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and CatBoost.

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the following:

- **Datasets:** The original datasets from Hungary, Switzerland, Cleveland, and Long Beach are included, along with the hybrid Sathvi dataset that has undergone missing value imputation.

- **Code:** Jupyter Notebook files that showcase the step-by-step process of hybrid dataset creation, missing value imputation, and the implementation of various machine learning classifiers.

- **Documentation:** Detailed explanations of the methodologies used, insights gained, and results obtained in the project.
